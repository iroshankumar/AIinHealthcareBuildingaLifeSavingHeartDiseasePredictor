# Heart Disease Prediction Web App ðŸ©ºðŸ’»

## Overview
Learning GCloud for ML & AI Model Deployment ðŸš€  

This project demonstrates deploying machine learning models on the cloud. I built a Heart Disease Prediction web application using **Python**, **Flask**, and multiple ML models. The app allows users to:

- Select from **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, **SVM**, or **KNN**
- Input patient medical data
- Receive **instant heart disease risk predictions**

This project was a hands-on experience in full-stack ML deployment, giving insights into real-world challenges in serving models online.

## Key Takeaways

- Full-stack ML deployment on **Google Cloud App Engine**  
- Handling **model files** and **dependencies** for cloud environments  
- Configuring **Gunicorn** for production-ready Flask apps  
- Managing **service accounts** and **billing** for cloud deployment

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/iroshankumar/AIinHealthcareBuildingaLifeSavingHeartDiseasePredictor.git
cd project-helth
````

2. Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage

1. Run the Flask application:

```bash
python app.py
```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to interact with the app.
3. Select a model, enter patient data, and receive predictions in real time.

## Models Included

* Logistic Regression
* Random Forest
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

All models are pre-trained and stored as `.pkl` files for immediate use.
